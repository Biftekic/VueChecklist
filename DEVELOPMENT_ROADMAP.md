5. **Mobile performance**: Profile regularly, optimize continuously

### Mitigation Strategies
- Start with core features, add complexity gradually
- Test on real devices early and often
- Get user feedback after each phase
- Keep UI simple and beautiful (priority #1)
- Document decisions and architecture
