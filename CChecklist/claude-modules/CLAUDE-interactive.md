# CLAUDE Module: Interactive Template Generator

## Module Overview

This module enables interactive, question-based template generation through simple Q&A format. It works alongside other modules to create customized cleaning templates through user-friendly conversations.

## Implementation Architecture

### Integration Points

1. **Primary Integration**: Add to main `CLAUDE.md` as a special module
2. **Module Type**: Meta-module that uses other modules
3. **Activation**: Triggered by phrases like "I need [type] cleaning" or "Create cleaning template"

## Interactive Flow Structure

### Step 1: Initial Recognition
When user says "I need office cleaning" or similar:
```markdown
I'll help you create a customized office cleaning template. I'll ask you a series of simple questions. Most will be yes/no or short answers.

Ready to start? (yes/no)
```

### Step 2: Progressive Questioning
Questions are asked one at a time, building on previous answers.

## Question Templates

### Facility Type Questions
```markdown
Q1: You need OFFICE cleaning, correct? (yes/no)
[If no, show menu of options]
```

### Size Questions
```markdown
Q2: What is the total area in square meters?
Answer: ___ mÂ²
```

### Room Inventory
```markdown
Q3: How many of each room type do you have?
- Standard offices: ___
- Meeting rooms: ___
- Restrooms: ___
[Continue list based on facility type]
```

## Data Collection Format

### Internal Data Structure
```yaml
template_generation:
  session_id: [unique]
  facility_type: [type]
  responses:
    q1_facility_confirm: yes
    q2_total_area: 350
    q3_floors: 2
    q4_floor_breakdown: 
      floor_1: 175
      floor_2: 175
    [continues...]
```

## Integration with Existing Modules

### Module Selection Logic
```python
if facility_type == "office":
    load_module("CLAUDE-office.md")
elif facility_type == "medical":
    load_module("CLAUDE-medical.md")
# etc...
```

### Resource Integration
- Pull chemicals from `chemical-guide.md`
- Apply routes from `route-optimization.md`
- Validate with `validation-system.md`
- Use components from `base-components.md`

## Question Bank

### Universal Questions (All Facility Types)
1. Facility confirmation
2. Total area
3. Number of floors
4. Room inventory
5. Cleaning frequency
6. Service timing
7. Occupancy status
8. Special requirements

### Type-Specific Questions

#### Office-Specific
- Conference room technology?
- Executive offices?
- Sensitive documents?
- IT/Server rooms?

#### Medical-Specific  
- Patient rooms vs clinical?

## Response Processing

### Time Calculation Matrix
```yaml
base_times:
  office:
    small: 15  # minutes
    medium: 20
    large: 25
  restroom:
    single: 15
    multi: 25
  kitchen:
    small: 25
    large: 50
```

### Modifiers
```yaml
frequency_modifiers:
  daily: 0.7
  weekly: 1.0
  monthly: 1.5
  
occupancy_modifiers:
  empty: 1.0
  occupied: 1.3
```

## Output Generation

### Template Assembly Process
1. Load base template structure
2. Insert facility-specific data
3. Calculate all timings
4. Add only relevant rooms
5. Include special requirements
6. Apply validation checks

## Usage Instructions
