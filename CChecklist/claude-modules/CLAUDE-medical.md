   - Spill kits
   - Warning signs (Wet Floor, Isolation)

## Timing Modifications

### Factors Affecting Duration
- **Isolation Status**: Add 15-20 minutes for PPE protocols
- **Occupancy**: Occupied rooms take 20-30% longer
- **Terminal Cleaning**: 2-3x standard cleaning time
- **OR Turnover**: Requires rapid 15-30 minute protocols
- **Outbreak Situations**: Enhanced protocols add 40-50% time

### Efficiency Considerations
- Zone cleaning to minimize cross-contamination
- Team cleaning for large areas
- Cart preparation to reduce trips
- Scheduled cleaning during low-census periods

## Safety Protocols

### Bloodborne Pathogen Precautions
1. Assume all bodily fluids are infectious
2. Use appropriate PPE
3. Proper sharps handling
4. Immediate spill response
5. Exposure incident procedures

### Chemical Safety
1. Never mix chemicals
2. Proper dilution ratios
3. Contact time compliance
4. Ventilation requirements
5. SDS readily available

### Infection Control
1. Hand hygiene before and after each room
2. PPE donning/doffing procedures
3. Clean-to-dirty workflow
4. No touch cleaning when possible
5. Equipment disinfection between rooms
