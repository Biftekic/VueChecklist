# Route Optimization Framework

## Overview

This framework provides systematic approaches to optimize cleaning routes, minimize backtracking, reduce equipment movement, and improve overall efficiency. Proper route planning can reduce cleaning time by 15-30%.

## Core Principles

### 1. Top-to-Bottom Cleaning
- Start with highest surfaces (ceiling fans, vents)
- Work down to floors last
- Prevents re-contamination of cleaned areas

### 2. Back-to-Front Movement
- Begin at furthest point from exit
- Work toward the door
- Avoid walking on cleaned floors

### 3. Clean-to-Dirty Progression
- Start with cleanest areas (offices, conference rooms)
- Progress to moderately soiled (kitchens, break rooms)
- End with dirtiest areas (restrooms)
- Prevents cross-contamination

### 4. Clockwise/Counterclockwise Pattern
- Choose one direction and stick to it
- Reduces missed areas
- Creates systematic workflow

## Route Optimization by Facility Type

### Office Buildings

#### Single Floor Route
```
START → Reception → Private Offices → Conference Rooms → 
Break Room → Copy/Supply Rooms → Hallways → Restrooms → 
Utility Areas → EXIT
```

#### Multi-Floor Strategy
1. **Vertical Approach**: Complete one floor entirely before moving
2. **Task-Based**: Do all offices, then all restrooms, etc.
3. **Team Approach**: Assign floors to team members

#### Time-Saving Tips
- Group similar tasks (all trash, then all dusting)
- Use cart staging at central locations
- Pre-position supplies on each floor

### Medical Facilities

#### Standard Route (Non-Infectious)
```
START → Administrative Offices → Waiting Rooms → 
Exam Rooms (unoccupied) → Hallways → Nurses Stations → 
Break Rooms → Public Restrooms → Clinical Areas → 
Soiled Utility → EXIT
```

#### Isolation Protocol Route
```
Non-Isolation Areas First → Standard Precaution Rooms → 
Contact Precaution → Droplet Precaution → 
Airborne Precaution → Terminal Cleans Last
```

#### Critical Considerations
- Never backtrack from dirty to clean
- Change PPE between isolation rooms
- Dedicated equipment for each zone

### Educational Facilities

#### Classroom Wing Route
```
START → Faculty Offices → Standard Classrooms → 
Computer Labs → Science Labs → Art Rooms → 
Music Rooms → Hallways → Student Restrooms → EXIT
```

#### After-Hours Optimization
1. Start with areas that need most drying time
2. Coordinate with evening activities
3. Complete high-traffic areas last

### Restaurant/Food Service

#### Kitchen Deep Clean Route
```
START → Dry Storage → Walk-in Cooler → Prep Areas → 
Cooking Line (cold to hot) → Dishwashing → 
Floor Drains → Floors → EXIT
```

#### Dining Area Route
```
START → Private Dining → Main Dining (back to front) → 
Bar Area → Host Station → Entry → Restrooms → EXIT
```

## Equipment Movement Strategies

### Cart Positioning

#### Central Staging
- Position cart in center of area
- Work outward in zones
- Minimizes travel distance

#### Perimeter Method
- Move cart along outer walls
- Work inward to center
- Good for open floor plans

#### Zone Parking
- Divide facility into zones
- Park cart at zone boundaries
- Reduces overall movement

### Supply Management

#### Two-Cart System
- Cart 1: Current zone
- Cart 2: Pre-staged at next zone
- Leap-frog through facility

#### Satellite Stations
- Small supply caches in closets
- Reduce main cart trips
- Stock weekly

## Task Batching Strategies

### Chemical-Based Batching

#### Sequence Example
1. **Dusting** (no chemicals) - All areas
2. **Glass/Mirrors** (glass cleaner) - All areas
3. **Disinfecting** (disinfectant) - All surfaces
4. **Floor Care** (floor cleaner) - All floors

### Tool-Based Batching

#### Vacuum Route
- Start furthest from storage
- Work systematically back
- One pass through facility

#### Mop Route
- After all dry work complete
- Start at furthest point
- Use figure-8 pattern back

### Time-Based Batching

#### Quick Tasks First
- Empty all trash (5 min/room)
- Check all supplies (2 min/room)
- Spot clean visible areas

#### Deep Tasks Second
- Detailed cleaning
- Moving furniture
- Scrubbing/extraction

## Multi-Floor Optimization

### Elevator Strategy

#### Supply Movement
- Use service elevator when possible
- Stage supplies on each floor
- Minimize trips between floors

#### Team Coordination
- Stagger floor starts
- Share elevator time
- Communicate completions

### Stairwell Efficiency

#### Top-Down Approach
1. Take supplies to top floor
2. Clean downward
3. Carry only essentials between floors

#### Bottom-Up Method
1. Clean stairs while ascending
2. Complete top floor
3. Work down via elevator

## Route Optimization Tools

### Daily Route Checklist

```
PRE-SHIFT
□ Review facility layout
□ Check special requests
□ Note closed/occupied areas
□ Position equipment
□ Stock cart properly

DURING SHIFT
□ Follow planned route
□ Mark completed areas
□ Note obstacles/changes
□ Track actual times

POST-SHIFT
□ Return equipment to storage
□ Note route improvements
□ Update next day's plan
```

## Seasonal Adjustments

### Winter Routes
- Start with entrances (salt/snow)
- Increase mat cleaning frequency
- Adjust for wet floor drying

### Summer Routes
- Early morning for exterior
- Account for increased traffic
- Adjust for AC condensation

### Special Event Routes
- Pre-event: Focus on visible areas
- During: Maintain high-traffic only
- Post-event: Full deep clean

## Team Route Coordination

### Zone Assignment
```
Team Member A: Offices + Conference
Team Member B: Restrooms + Break rooms
Team Member C: Common areas + Floors
Floater: Assists and fills gaps
```

### Communication Protocol
- Start/end times by zone
- Completion notifications
- Obstacle alerts
- Supply needs

## Technology Integration

### Digital Route Mapping
- Use facility management software
- Track actual vs. planned routes
- Identify bottlenecks
- Generate efficiency reports

### QR Code Checkpoints

## Efficiency Metrics

### Key Performance Indicators
1. **Square Feet per Hour**
   - Baseline: 3,000-5,000 sq ft/hour
   - Optimized: 4,000-7,000 sq ft/hour

2. **Steps per Shift**
   - Measure with pedometer
   - Aim to reduce by 20%

3. **Cart Refills**
   - Track per shift
   - Goal: Minimize to 1-2

4. **Backtracking Incidents**
   - Document occurrences
   - Identify pattern causes

### Route Scoring System
```
Excellent (90-100%): Optimal route, minimal backtracking
Good (80-89%): Efficient with minor improvements needed
Fair (70-79%): Some backtracking, needs optimization
Poor (<70%): Significant inefficiency, redesign needed
