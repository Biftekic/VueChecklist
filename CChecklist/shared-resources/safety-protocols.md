# Universal Safety Protocols for Professional Cleaning

## Overview
This document contains standardized safety protocols applicable across all cleaning environments. These guidelines should be referenced by all cleaning template modules to ensure consistent safety practices.

## General Safety Principles

### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
**Minimum Requirements for All Cleaning:**
- Rubber gloves (nitrile preferred for latex allergies)
- Closed-toe, non-slip footwear
- Eye protection when using spray chemicals
- Long pants and sleeves recommended

**Additional PPE by Risk Level:**
- **Standard Risk:** Basic PPE as above
- **Medium Risk:** Add dust mask, knee pads
- **High Risk:** Add safety goggles, apron, face shield
- **Hazardous:** Full protective suit, respirator (requires training)

### Chemical Safety

#### Universal Chemical Rules
1. **Never Mix Chemicals**
   - NEVER mix bleach with ammonia (creates toxic chloramine gas)
   - NEVER mix bleach with acids (creates chlorine gas)
   - NEVER mix hydrogen peroxide with vinegar (creates peracetic acid)
   - When in doubt, don't mix

2. **Proper Chemical Handling**
   - Read all labels before use
   - Follow manufacturer dilution instructions
   - Use in well-ventilated areas
   - Store chemicals in original containers
   - Keep chemicals away from heat sources
   - Never use food containers for chemicals

3. **Chemical Storage**
   - Store in locked cabinet when possible
   - Keep away from children and pets
   - Separate incompatible chemicals
   - Maintain temperature per label
   - Check expiration dates monthly
   - Dispose of old chemicals properly

#### First Aid for Chemical Exposure
**Eye Contact:**
1. Flush with water for 15 minutes minimum
2. Remove contact lenses if present
3. Seek medical attention immediately

**Skin Contact:**
1. Remove contaminated clothing
2. Flush area with water for 15 minutes
3. Apply appropriate first aid per SDS
4. Seek medical attention for burns

**Inhalation:**
1. Move to fresh air immediately
2. Loosen tight clothing
3. If breathing difficult, call 911
4. Provide oxygen if trained

**Ingestion:**
1. Never induce vomiting
2. Call Poison Control: 1-800-222-1222
3. Have chemical label ready
4. Follow their instructions exactly

### Physical Safety

#### Slip, Trip, and Fall Prevention
- Place "Wet Floor" signs immediately
- Clean spills as they occur
- Wear slip-resistant footwear
- Keep cords away from walkways
- Use proper ladder technique
- Never rush on wet surfaces
- Report damaged flooring

#### Lifting and Ergonomics
**Proper Lifting Technique:**
1. Assess weight before lifting
2. Bend knees, not back
3. Keep load close to body
4. Lift with legs, not back
5. Pivot feet, don't twist
6. Get help for heavy items (>50 lbs)

**Ergonomic Practices:**
- Alternate repetitive tasks
- Take stretch breaks every 2 hours
- Adjust equipment to proper height
- Use extension tools when possible
- Push rather than pull when possible

#### Electrical Safety
- Inspect cords before each use
- Never use damaged equipment
- Keep liquids away from outlets
- Unplug equipment before cleaning
- Use GFCI outlets in wet areas
- Don't overload circuits
- Report electrical issues immediately

### Biological Hazards

#### Bloodborne Pathogens
**If Blood or Body Fluids Present:**
1. Do not clean without proper PPE
2. Use EPA-registered disinfectant
3. Apply disinfectant liberally
4. Allow proper contact time (usually 1 minute)
5. Double-bag contaminated materials
6. Dispose in biohazard container
7. Report exposure incidents

#### Mold and Mildew
- Wear N95 mask minimum
- Ensure good ventilation
- Use EPA-registered fungicide
- Never dry brush moldy surfaces
- Contain affected area if possible
- Report extensive mold (>10 sq ft)

### Equipment Safety

#### Ladder Safety
- Inspect before each use
- Set on level, stable surface
- Maintain 3-point contact
- Don't exceed weight limit
- Face ladder when climbing
- Never stand on top 2 rungs
- Have spotter when possible

#### Vacuum Safety
- Check bag/filter fullness
- Inspect cord and plug
- Clear area of small objects first
- Never vacuum liquids (unless wet/dry vac)
- Unplug when changing bags
- Report unusual noises

#### Power Equipment
- Read manual before first use
- Perform pre-use inspection
- Use correct attachments
- Never bypass safety features
- Keep hands away from moving parts
- Unplug when not in use

### Emergency Procedures
