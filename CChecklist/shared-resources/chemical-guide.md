- **1:64** = 2 oz per gallon
- **1:128** = 1 oz per gallon
- **1:256** = 0.5 oz per gallon

### Dilution Best Practices
1. Always add chemical to water, not water to chemical
2. Use cool or lukewarm water unless specified
3. Measure accurately - use measuring cups
4. Label diluted solutions with date
5. Make fresh solutions daily when possible

### Cost-Effective Dilution
- Buy concentrates when trained in proper dilution
- Use dispensing systems for consistency
- Track dilution costs vs. ready-to-use
- Consider labor time in cost calculations

## Chemical Safety & Handling

### Storage Requirements

#### General Storage Rules

### Mixing Hazards

#### Dangerous Chemical Combinations
**Bleach + Ammonia** = Chloramine gas (toxic)
**Bleach + Acids** = Chlorine gas (toxic)
**Bleach + Hydrogen Peroxide** = Oxygen gas (fire hazard)
**Different Drain Cleaners** = Violent reaction
**Acids + Bases** = Heat and splashing

## Chemical Compatibility Matrix

   - Allow surface to dry if switching chemical types
   - Never spray one chemical over another

2. **Safe Sequences**
   - Degreaser → Rinse → Disinfectant
   - Acid cleaner → Rinse thoroughly → Neutral cleaner
   - Alkaline → Rinse → Neutral → Disinfectant

3. **Time Delays Required**
   - After bleach: Wait 30 minutes and rinse before other chemicals
   - After acids: Rinse and wait 15 minutes
   - After ammonia: Ventilate and rinse thoroughly
