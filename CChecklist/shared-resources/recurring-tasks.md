## Task Batching for Efficiency

### Chemical-Based Batching

2. **Glass Cleaner Tasks:** Mirrors, windows, glass surfaces
3. **All-Purpose Tasks:** General surfaces, spot cleaning

### Tool-Based Batching
Group tasks using the same tools:
1. **Vacuum Tasks:** All carpeted areas in sequence
2. **Mop Tasks:** All hard floors after vacuuming
3. **Dusting Tasks:** High-to-low in all rooms

### Route Optimization
1. **Top-to-Bottom:** Always clean from highest to lowest surfaces
2. **Back-to-Front:** Start from furthest point, work toward exit
3. **Wet-to-Dry:** Complete all wet cleaning before dry tasks
4. **Clean-to-Dirty:** Cleanest areas first (offices) to dirtiest (restrooms)

## Integration Instructions

### For Template Creation
1. Add universal recurring tasks to EACH room section
2. Include frequency callouts based on cleaning type
3. Note task batching opportunities
4. Add route optimization notes

### Time Calculation
- Add 10-15 minutes per room for universal recurring tasks
- Add 20% time buffer for weekly tasks
- Add 40% time buffer for monthly deep cleaning

### Marking Recurring Tasks
Use special notation in templates:
- **[DAILY]** - Must be done every cleaning
- **[WEEKLY]** - Once per week minimum
- **[MONTHLY]** - Monthly deep clean item
- **[QUARTERLY]** - Seasonal deep cleaning

## Customization Variables

### By Facility Size
- **Small (<5,000 sq ft):** Focus on daily/weekly tasks
- **Medium (5,000-20,000 sq ft):** Full recurring schedule
- **Large (>20,000 sq ft):** Zone-based recurring tasks

### By Industry Requirements
- **Healthcare:** Double frequency for disinfection
